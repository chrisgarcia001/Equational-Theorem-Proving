# Equational-Theorem-Proving
A small Prolog equational theorem proving system with two demo theorem provers

This repository contains a small Prolog-based equational theorem proving system. Based on term rewriting, this system facilitates theorem proving by equational transformation based on user-defined term rewriting rules. A term rewriting rule specifes a left-hand side (LHS) and a right-hand (RHS) side together with a rule name. Expressions matching the LHS can be replaced with the corresponding RHS. Expressions are represented as Prolog lists. For example, the expression *a + b* would be represented as `[a, +, b]`.

This system is able to generate equational proofs using the user-defined term rewriting rules. A theorem prover consists of three components:

1. The Reasoning Engine (derivation.pro): This core component produces the equational proofs.
2. The Term Rewriting Ruleset (see, for example, tiny_ruleset.pro): This is a Prolog file that specifies the rewriting rules to be used.
3. The User Interface (prover_ui.pro): This receives input from the user and then formats and prints the resulting proofs.

The theorem prover architecture is depicted below:

![Figure 1: Theorem prover architecture](./images/prover-architecture.jpg)

Users can interact with the system in the Prolog command prompt via the top-level predicate *prove*, which has the following form:

*prove(LHS, RHS, MaxProofSteps)*

In this case, LHS and RHS are list-based starting (LHS) and ending (RHS) expressions to be proven equal by at most the maximum number of proof steps.

Two small demo theorem provers are included: 1) a propositional logic equivalence prover, and 2) a trigonometric identity theorem prover.

### Demo 1: A Propositional Logic Equivalence Theorem Prover
This theorem prover can generate equational proofs for propositional equivalences using the axioms in Table 1 below:

Example proofs generated by this system are shown below for two problems taken from *Discrete Structures, Logic, and Computability* by James L. Hein (2nd. ed., p. 355 and 368).
